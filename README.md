This is a personal project called LOR.

1) What is this project?
  -> This is a web application project built using node js, exp js, postgresql.
  -> It is a one stop solution to the hedious manual process involved in issuing a Letter Of Recommedation to 4th year students for Post Graduate Studies at my college.
2) What is the Problem this project is solving?
  -> The existing process for  a student to obtain a LOR is to personally talk to the respective faculty, submit physical copies of his/her documents, meeting the faculty regularly (many a times a very tiring as many of the teaching faculty members, especially the senior professors, have very busy schedules making it hard for them to schedule a meeting with the students), making appropriate changes after every meeting, discussing about his/her achievements, extracurriculars, academics etc. and finally if the professor issues an LOR to the student as he/she sees fit.
